              The Oakhurst Dog Park is one of three dog parks in the city of
              Decatur and is 100% community-maintained. The city provides
              resources, but itâ€™s the park-goers who keep the grounds clean and
              welcoming.
            </p>

            <p>
              We are proud to be first dog park to be named a wildlife sanctuary
              by the Atlanta Audubon Society. There are several birdhouses and
              bat houses and a 1300 sqft pollinator garden, where no unnatural
              chemicals are used.
