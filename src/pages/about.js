            The Oakhurst Dog Park is one of three dog parks in the city of
            Decatur and is 100% community-maintained. The city provides
            resources, but itâ€™s the park-goers who keep the grounds clean and
            welcoming.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            The park features a large open field (a natural flood plain), with
            some shaded areas and benches for visitors. Sitting above the field
            is a wooded area with well-maintained walking paths.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            The park was the first dog park to be named a wildlife sanctuary by
            the Atlanta Audubon Society. There are several birdhouses and bat
            houses and a 1300 sqft pollinator garden, where no unnatural
            chemicals are used.
