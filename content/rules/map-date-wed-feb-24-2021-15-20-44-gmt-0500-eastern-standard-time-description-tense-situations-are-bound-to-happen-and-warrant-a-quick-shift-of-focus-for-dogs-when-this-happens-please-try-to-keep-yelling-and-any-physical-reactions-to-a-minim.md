rulebrief: If a dangerous situation arises, try to remain calm

category: Behavior
description: Tense situations are bound to happen, and warrant a quick shift of
  focus for dogs. When this happens, please try to keep yelling and any physical
  reactions to a minimum. Both can increase adrenaline and stress. Remove your
  dog (and yourself) from the immediate area and give everyone time to cool off.
