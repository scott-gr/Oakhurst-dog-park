description: >-
  Small children, especially running children, may be regarded as prey animals
  by other dogs. Dogs may also feel the urge to protect children they know. This
  tends to cause aggressive behavior.


  If you must bring children to a dog park, supervise them closely. Children must NOT be allowed to behave in ways that could excite or startle the dogs in the park.Â Also, do not let children roll logs or turn over rocks, it damages the park environment and they could disturb snakes.
